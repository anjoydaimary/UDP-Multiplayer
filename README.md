# udp-unity-tests

Learning project for figuring out how to do a UDPClient-based networked game with Unity.

This is a test client to accomodate the Python-based server project [here](https://github.com/lxndrdagreat/udp-socket-server).

# Disclaimer I

I do *not* recommend this project as a solution for your game networking needs!

It is a learning project.

However, I have been storing it publically just in case there is something I have
learned that might be helpful for others.

# Disclaimer II

There is a lot of stuff "wrong" with this project and it will possibly not even work.

However, I have been able to use it as a starting point for a different project, which
has a much-improved codebase. Eventually, once I have that project in a final state,
I plan on updating both this project and the server project (link above) to include
the improvements.
